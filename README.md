# libc.hwid
## C# cross platform hardware ID generator
### Unique hardware ID generator for protecting your distributed .net software (Ubuntu, Windows & Mac OS Big Sur)

### Why we need this?
- We want to distribute a software and we worry about possible copyright violations.
- We don't want your software to be distributed without our consent

### How does it work?
- `HwId.Generate()` method combines __Motherboard info__ with __CPU ID__ into a string
- Then hashes the string into a 40 character ASCII string. This final string value is the __Hardware ID__

### Considerations:
- So called __Hardware ID__, created with `HwId.Generate()` method, will return the same value on a computer system as long as the _mother board_ and _CPU_ __do not change__
- This library does not use _Mac address_ by default (but can be argumented to do so) since the value returned from WMI on Microsoft Windows will change if the computer's network connection is lost or disabled.

### I've used this piece of code in my projects on the following operating systems:
- Ubuntu 16.04
- Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS
- Windows 7
- Windows 7 SP1
- Windows 8
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10
- MacOS Big Sur

### Usage:
The nuget package is written as a __.Net Standard 2.0__ & __.Net 5.0__ class library, so you can use it in the following project types:
- .Net Standard 2.0+
- .Net 5.0
- .Net Core 2.0+
- .Net Framework 4.6.1+

Just add this [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/libc.hwid/) to your project and use as below:
```csharp
var hardwareId = libc.hwid.HwId.Generate();
```
Take a look at tests to understand the usage better
